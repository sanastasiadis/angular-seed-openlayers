This project has been created as a study for integration of an angular application based on angular-seed, with openlayers for maps presentation.

angular-seed (https://github.com/mgechev/angular-seed) is used as a base for this project.

ngx-openlayers (https://github.com/quentin-ol/ngx-openlayers) is used to display maps.

Angular-seed was forked, and ngx-openlayers was installed as a project using:

```bash
npm install ngx-openlayers --save.
```

The corresponding SystemJS configuration is added on the `/tools/config/project.config.ts` file for ngx-openlayers and openlayers.

As a proof of concept, a simple map component is displayed on the home page of the example.
